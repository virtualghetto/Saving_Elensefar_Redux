description="Elensefar has been overrun by orcs, now you had to gather an army to sucessfull retake it.

Non-linear seafaring campaign — small armies, tiny maps and refreshing new game mechanics.

Saving Elensefar was orginally by turin and trewe. Saving Elensefar Redux is a fork from the latest available version by trewe."
