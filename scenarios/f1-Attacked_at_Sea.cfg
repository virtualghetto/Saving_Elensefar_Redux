            story= _ "The city had fallen, but Meneldur and his crew had escaped. Leaving the harbor, and looking back at the city, they noticed something strange. The orcs were not burning the city and pillaging it, as was their habit; instead, they were leaving it alone, and concentrating on the Lord's castle. It was almost as if they wanted to control the city, instead of destroy it."

            story= _ "Meneldur was not sure exactly what this meant, but he knew one thing - if the city was not destroyed, then the people in it would not be either. Which meant that the city would still be worth rescuing. Thus, he and Madru, right there, vowed that, if they could, they would raise an army and return to Elensefar, to defeat the orcs and claim whatever of the city remained."
